The MediaPipe Image Embedder task lets you create a numeric representation of an image, which is useful in accomplishing various ML-based image tasks. This functionality is frequently used to compare the similarity of two images using mathematical comparison techniques such as Cosine Similarity. This task operates on image data with a machine learning (ML) model as static data or a continuous stream, and outputs a numeric representation of the image data as a list of high-dimensional feature vectors, also known as embedding vectors, in either floating-point or quantized form.
